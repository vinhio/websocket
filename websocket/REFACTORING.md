# WebSocket Package Refactoring

## Overview

This document describes the refactoring changes made to the WebSocket package to improve code quality, maintainability, and readability.

## Changes Made

### 1. Refactored `advanceFrame` Method in `conn.go`

The `advanceFrame` method in `conn.go` was a large, complex method (approximately 185 lines) with multiple responsibilities. It has been refactored into smaller, more focused functions:

- `skipRemainingFrame`: Skips any remaining data in the current frame
- `readFrameHeader`: Reads and parses the frame header
- `readFrameLength`: Reads and parses the frame length
- `handleFrameMasking`: Handles the masking of WebSocket frames
- `enforceReadLimit`: Enforces the read limit for data frames
- `readControlFramePayload`: Reads the payload of a control frame
- `processControlFrame`: Processes a control frame

The `advanceFrame` method now calls these functions, making it more modular and easier to understand. Each extracted function has a clear responsibility and is well-documented with comments.

### 2. Refactored `Upgrade` Method in `server.go`

The `Upgrader.Upgrade` method in `server.go` has been broken down into several smaller helper methods:

- `returnError`: Handles error responses during the upgrade process
- `selectSubprotocol`: Selects the appropriate subprotocol based on client and server preferences
- `negotiateCompression`: Determines if compression should be enabled for the connection
- `setupBufferedReader`: Sets up the buffered reader for the connection
- `setupWriteBuffer`: Prepares the write buffer for the connection
- `createWebSocketConnection`: Creates the WebSocket connection with the appropriate parameters
- `setConnectionDeadline`: Sets the connection deadline for the handshake
- `clearConnectionDeadline`: Clears the connection deadline after the handshake

Additionally, a new helper function `generateUpgradeResponse` was extracted to handle the creation of the HTTP upgrade response.

### 3. Refactored `DialContext` Method in `client.go`

The `Dialer.DialContext` method in `client.go` has been broken down into several smaller helper methods:

- `createHandshakeRequest`: Creates the HTTP handshake request
- `setupNetDial`: Sets up the network dialer with appropriate options
- `setupTLSConnection`: Configures and establishes the TLS connection
- `performHandshake`: Performs the WebSocket handshake with the server

These changes make the client connection process more modular and easier to understand.

### 4. Completely Restructured `proxy.go`

The `proxy.go` file has been significantly refactored:

- Created `httpProxyDialer` struct to encapsulate HTTP proxy functionality
- Broke down the `DialContext` method into smaller helper methods:
  - `connectToProxy`: Establishes a connection to the proxy server
  - `createConnectRequest`: Creates the HTTP CONNECT request
  - `addProxyAuth`: Adds proxy authentication if needed
  - `processProxyResponse`: Processes the HTTP response from the proxy
  - `cleanupResponse`: Properly cleans up the HTTP response
  - `handleFailedConnection`: Handles failed connection attempts

The `proxyFromURL` function has also been improved with better comments and clearer logic.

### 5. Optimized and Refactored `mask.go`

The `maskBytes` function in `mask.go` has been broken down into smaller helper functions:

- `maskSmallBuffer`: Applies masking to small buffers byte by byte
- `alignToWordBoundary`: Aligns the buffer to a word boundary for efficient processing
- `maskAlignedWords`: Processes the buffer one word at a time for maximum efficiency
- `maskRemainingBytes`: Processes any remaining bytes

The code now has much better comments explaining the purpose and functionality of each function, as well as the overall masking strategy.

### 6. Improved Error Handling in `join.go`

The `join.go` file has been refactored with better error handling:

- The `JoinMessages` function now includes proper error handling for nil connections
- A new `errorReader` type has been introduced to handle error cases
- The `joinReader` type has been improved with better comments and clearer logic

### 7. Refactored `FastHTTPUpgrader.Upgrade` in `server_fasthttp.go`

The `FastHTTPUpgrader.Upgrade` method in `server_fasthttp.go` has been broken down into smaller helper methods:

- `responseError`: Handles error responses during the upgrade process
- `selectSubprotocol`: Selects the appropriate subprotocol based on client and server preferences
- `isCompressionEnable`: Determines if compression should be enabled for the connection

### 8. Restructured `compression.go`

The `compression.go` file has been refactored to improve readability and maintainability:

- Created helper functions:
  - `decompressNoContextTakeover`: Handles decompression with no context takeover
  - `isValidCompressionLevel`: Validates compression levels
  - `compressNoContextTakeover`: Handles compression with no context takeover
- Created helper types with clear responsibilities:
  - `truncWriter`: Handles truncation of compressed data
  - `flateWriteWrapper`: Wraps the flate writer with additional functionality
  - `flateReadWrapper`: Wraps the flate reader with additional functionality

## Benefits

1. **Improved Readability**: The code is now easier to read and understand, with clear function names that describe their purpose.

2. **Better Maintainability**: Smaller, focused functions are easier to maintain and modify than large, complex ones.

3. **Enhanced Testability**: Smaller functions with clear responsibilities are easier to test in isolation.

4. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Developers can focus on one aspect of the code at a time, rather than trying to understand a large, complex method.

5. **Better Documentation**: Each function now has a clear comment describing its purpose and behavior.

6. **Improved Error Handling**: Many of the refactored components now have better error handling and recovery mechanisms.

7. **Better Code Organization**: The code is now better organized with clearer separation of concerns.

## Future Improvements

Additional refactoring opportunities that could be considered in the future:

1. Further refactoring of large methods in `conn.go` and other files
2. Improving error handling and recovery
3. Enhancing documentation with more detailed examples and use cases
4. Adding more comprehensive tests for the refactored functions
5. Implementing more performance optimizations, especially for high-traffic scenarios
6. Enhancing security features and validations
